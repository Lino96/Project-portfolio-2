# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Portfolio 2

Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game usually played by two people, where players simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The "rock" beats scissors, the "scissors" beat paper and the "paper" beats rock; if both players throw the same shape, the game is tied. Other names for the game in the English-speaking world include roshambo, and other orderings of the three items.

# UX

- There is one button for rock, which is a closed fist

- There is one button for paper, which is a flat hand

- there is one button for scissors, which is a closed hand with two finger forming a V,

- Under the 3 buttons, there is the player counter score which increment by 1 every time we beat the computer.

- above the three button, there is a space dedicated to player choice, at the start it will be blank, it's gonna fill as soon as player chooses either rock, paper or scissors.

- on the top there is the computer counter score which increment by 1 every time computer beats player.

- under computer scoore there is a space dedicated to computer choice, at the start it will be blank, it's gonna fill simultaneously with player choice, choosing randomly between rock paper or scissors.

- Once the user has pressed one of the control buttons, the code will generate a random number between 0 and 2 to reflect the computers choice.

- The rules are as follows:-

    - Rock beats Scissors
    - Scissors beats Paper
    - Paper beats Rock
